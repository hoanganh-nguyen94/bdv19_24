# Longest duplicated string

## Problem

Please find the longest duplicated string (incase-sensitive, no leading or trailing spaces) from the input.txt. The solution is going to be tested with a text file consists of ~1000.000 characters and timed so that any algorithm with complexity of N^2 wouldn't work.

## Input:
A file (input.txt) with the text from which the duplicated string needs to be found

Example of the file:
```
This is a long text. And this is also a long text.
```

## Expected output: a file at [output.txt](output.txt) contains duplicated string from the input.txt

```
a long text.
```

## NOTES:
### run.sh must be modified to include all steps to build, compile and run your program to produce the desired output.txt
### Character encoding of the output file should be UTF-8
### Make sure to NOT include any "redundant spaces/lines" in the output.txt as an exact comparison is going to be used for evaluation
### Linux's newline character must be used when needed
